# Chimera Arena (Jam version)
A game created for Game Maker's Toolkit 2021 Game Jam. The theme was "Joined Together." 

Build a chimera and fight your way to the very top in turn based combat!

Will this be made into a full game? Probably not, but I differentiated it just in case.

Made in Unity 2020.3.2f1. If you would like to build this, using that version is recommended.
